TI  - Benefits of nutritional intervention on nutritional status, quality of
      life and survival.
PG  - 66-8
AB  - Most cancers in children are acute diseases. Therefore, the incidence of
      malnutrition, in general, is not different from the incidence in the
      referral population. Some specific tumors, such as neuroblastoma and those
      resulting in the diencephalic syndrome, can be exceptions. By contrast,
      malnutrition is a frequent problem during modern intensive cancer
      treatment as the result of the associated anorexia, altered taste
      sensations and catabolic effects of drugs. In addition, there are
      psychogenic factors and metabolic consequences associated with the tumor
      itself. Nutritional support does improve the feeling of well-being and
      performance status, while maintaining or improving the immune competence,
      thereby potentially affecting survival by limiting infectious episodes.
      There is no convincing evidence to date that nutritional support has an
      antineoplastic effect per se, but deficiency of a specific nutrient might
      be beneficial because of a differential requirement between tumor and
      normal cells. Theoretically, nutritional support might enhance tumor
      growth but also susceptibility to chemotherapy. In either case, nutrition
      is a support modality that must be given with appropriate tumor-directed
      therapy if curative intent is the goal of treatment. Nutrition remains a
      consideration after therapy is completed. This generates different
      challenges. If further tumor-directed therapy is futile, the decision to
      continue nutritional support is difficult, but if the child is well,
      nutritional rehabilitation must be pursued. Finally, the cured child
      continues to benefit from dietary advice. Nutrition should be viewed for
      what it is: supplying the most basic need of children.

TI  - MOPP chemotherapy without irradiation as primary postsurgical therapy for
      brain tumors in infants and young children.
PG  - 243-52
AB  - Infants and young children who have brain tumors have a poor rate of
      survival and high treatment associated morbidity. A trial of
      mechlorethamine, vincristine (oncovin), procarbazine, and prednisone
      (MOPP) was performed to test the hypothesis that replacing radiotherapy
      with chemotherapy would improve survival and decrease long term morbidity
      of infants who have brain tumors. Between 1976 and 1988, 17 consecutive
      children less than 36 months old when diagnosed with medulloblastoma or
      ependymoma were treated with MOPP chemotherapy as primary therapy
      following surgical excision or biopsy of the tumor. Radiotherapy was
      reserved for recurrent disease. Ten of 17 children have survived without
      evidence of disease: medulloblastoma eight of 12 with median survival time
      of 10.6 years (range, 6.2 to 15.2 yrs); and ependymoma, 2 of 5 (at 13.0
      and 16.0 yrs). Four of the 10 children with medulloblastoma and ependymoma
      who relapsed are now disease free at 7.5, 11.7, 12.2 and 13.5 yrs post
      relapse after receiving salvage therapy with cisplatin (n = 1) or
      irradiation (n = 3). All relapses occurred within 26 months of diagnosis.
      Data on growth demonstrated height less than the 5th percentile in all
      children who received cranial irradiation compared to 25 to 95th
      percentile for nonirradiated children. Intellectual ability for the group
      who did not require radiation was within normal range (mean IQ 100.1) and
      stable across annual assessments. Those who required radiation had lower
      IOs which continued to decline over time (mean IQ 85 at mean age of 5.8
      years, declining to 63 at 10 years). In young children with brain tumors,
      primary chemotherapy with MOPP, omitting radiotherapy, provides improved
      neurodevelopmental outcome and survival.

TI  - Early hospital discharge and the timing of newborn metabolic screening.
PG  - 463-6
AB  - Cost containment measures have reduced dramatically the length of stay for
      normal newborns, in some cases jeopardizing the ability to obtain
      appropriate newborn screens. In our hospital, we found that an
      unacceptable number of patients had mistakenly been screened before 24
      hours of age. As pressures to shorten hospitalization increase,
      health-care providers must examine the impact of such changes on their
      ability to obtain adequate newborn screens. Potential solutions include
      continued vigilance in gathering specimens after 24 hours of age,
      interpretation of time-sensitive tests in an age-adjusted manner, and
      repeating newborn screens after 24 hours of age.
