TI  - Preventive intervention for urban, low-income preschoolers at familial
      risk for conduct problems: a randomized pilot study.
PG  - 246-57
AB  - Conducted a pilot study to test the feasibility of a prevention program
      for promoting parenting in families of preschoolers at high risk for
      behavior problems. Risk status was based on a family history of antisocial
      behavior and residence in a low-income, urban community. Thirty
      preschoolers (ages 21/2 to 5) and their parents were randomly assigned to
      a 1-year, home- and clinic-based intervention or to a no-intervention
      control condition. Despite families' multiple risk factors, high rates of
      attendance and satisfaction were achieved. Relative to controls,
      intervention parents were observed to be significantly more responsive and
      use more positive parenting practices. Results support the feasibility of
      engaging high-risk families in an intensive prevention program. The
      meaningful changes achieved in parenting suggest that a preventive
      approach is promising for families with multiple risk factors.

TI  - Complementary DNA sequences of ovarian follicular fluid inhibin show
      precursor structure and homology with transforming growth factor-beta.
PG  - 659-63
AB  - Inhibin, a specific and potent polypeptide inhibitor of the secretion of
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), of gonadal origin and thus a potential
      contraceptive, may constitute a missing link in the mechanism controlling
      the differential secretion of the pituitary gonadotropins. Inhibin-like
      bioactivity has been reported in various fluids and extracts of testis and
      in ovarian follicular fluid. Although there have been several attempts to
      purify inhibin from seminal plasma, purification from follicular fluid has
      been more successful (refs 14-16; for review see ref. 17). We have
      previously isolated two forms (A and B) of inhibin from porcine follicular
      fluid. Each form comprised two dissimilar subunits of relative molecular
      mass (Mr) 18,000 (18K, referred to here as the alpha-subunit) and 14K (the
      beta-subunit), crosslinked by one or more disulphide bridge(s). Forms A
      and B differ in the N-terminal sequence of their 14K subunit. Preliminary
      structural characterization of porcine and bovine ovarian inhibins shows
      that they have similar properties. Here, we have used the N-terminal
      amino-acid sequence data on the subunits of each inhibin to identify
      cloned complementary DNAs encoding the biosynthetic precursors and report
      that inhibins are the product of a gene family that also includes
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and whose structural
      organization is similar to that of pituitary and placental glycoprotein
      hormones.

TI  - Recent trends in state nursing home payment policies.
PG  - W4-363-73
AB  - State Medicaid programs pay for a sizable portion of overall nursing home
      expenditures. The repeal of the Boren amendment in 1997 gave states
      greater freedom to set Medicaid nursing home policy. This study presents
      data from a comprehensive survey of state nursing home payment policies
      during 1999-2002. Aggregate inflation-adjusted Medicaid payment rates rose
      steadily, and there was no sizable increase in the adoption of other
      cost-cutting policies. Although these findings can be interpreted with
      some optimism from a nursing home financing perspective, areas of concern
      remain for state nursing home policy during the next several years.

TI  - Down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in sitosterolemia: diminished
      activities of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
      synthase, reductase, squalene synthase, and 7-dehydrocholesterol
      delta7-reductase in liver and mononuclear leukocytes.
PG  - 44-50
AB  - Sitosterolemia is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by
      abnormally increased plasma and tissue plant sterol concentrations.
      Patients have markedly reduced whole body cholesterol biosynthesis
      associated with suppressed hepatic, ileal, and mononuclear leukocyte
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the
      rate-controlling enzyme in cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, coupled with
      significantly increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression.
      To investigate the mechanism of down-regulated cholesterol biosynthesis,
      we assayed several other key enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic
      pathway including acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, HMG-CoA synthase, squalene
      synthase, and 7-dehydrocholesterol delta7-reductase activities in liver
      and freshly isolated mononuclear leukocytes from four sitosterolemic
      patients and 19 controls. Hepatic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, HMG-CoA
      synthase, reductase, and squalene synthase activities were significantly
      decreased (P < 0.05) -39%, -54%, -76%, and -57%, respectively, and
      7-dehydrocholesterol delta7-reductase activity tended to be lower (-35%)
      in the sitosterolemic compared with control subjects. The reduced HMG-CoA
      synthase, reductase, and squalene synthase activities were also found in
      mononuclear leukocytes from a sitosterolemic patient. Thus, reduced
      cholesterol synthesis is caused not only by decreased HMG-CoA reductase
      but also by the coordinate down-regulation of entire pathway of
      cholesterol biosynthesis. These results suggest that inadequate
      cholesterol production in sitosterolemia is due to abnormal
      down-regulation of early, intermediate, and late enzymes in the
      cholesterol biosynthetic pathway rather than a single inherited defect in
      the HMG-CoA reductase gene.

TI  - Synthesis and relative potencies of new constrained CRF antagonists.
PG  - 2860-7
AB  - Two series of CRF antagonists with N alpha- and C alpha-methylated alanine
      and leucines were evaluated for their biological activities in vitro and
      in vivo in several systems. The poly-N-methylated analogue of
      alpha-helical-CRF9-41, [N alpha MeLeu10,15,27,37,N alpha
      MeAla22,32,41]-alpha-Hel-CRF9-41, was found to be considerably less potent
      than the parent non-N-methylated analogue. This result was expected on the
      basis that alpha-helicity was thought to be required for biological
      activity and the prediction that backbone substitutions on the nitrogen
      have a tendency to break alpha-helices (a hypothesis that was confirmed by
      circular dichroism). Next, a series of constrained analogues of the potent
      CRF antagonist, [DPhe12,Nle21,38]h/rCRF12-41, was synthesized that
      contained C alpha-methylleucine and/or C alpha-methylalanine (Aib)
      residues at selected positions. Because C alpha-methylation is recognized
      to increase alpha-helicity, and because there is now strong NMR data
      suggesting that residues 6-36 assume a well-defined alpha-helix, it was
      expected that these analogues would be more potent. Although usual
      solid-phase peptide synthesis procedures were followed, success in
      coupling the C alpha-methyl amino acids was obtained only with a 1:1
      mixture of BOP/HOBt. In vitro potencies of the synthesized compounds were
      measured in a collagenase-dispersed anterior pituitary cell culture
      bioassay. Monosubstituted analogues were shown to be twice to one fourth
      as potent as the parent compound; while the pluri-substituted peptides
      were slightly less potent. This decrease in potency might be correlated to
      an unexpected lower helical content of the pluri-substituted compounds (as
      determined by CD spectroscopy), as it was suggested that the bioactive
      conformation of the CRF was predominantly alpha-helical. Interestingly,
      one analogue, [DPhe12,Nle21,38,C alpha-MeLeu37]h/rCRF12-41, was found to
      be more potent and longer acting than the parent compound in two in vivo
      assays measuring ACTH release after intravenous administration to
      adrenalectomized rats and reversal of stress-induced delay in gastric
      emptying in the rat after intracisternal administration. The molecular
      basis for this increased duration of action and potency is being
      investigated.

AB  - Several lines of investigation identify common features of
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Alzheimer disease, and retroviral CNS
      infections. We discuss salient neuropathological, genetic, transmission,
      and transformation properties that suggest there may be common pathways in
      the pathogenesis of dementias. We also briefly present potential
      retroviral mechanisms that may be implicated in all of these dementias.

AB  - The authors report a family with Best's vitelliform macular dystrophy in
      which one member developed a macular hole and retinal detachment. The
      retinal detachment was repaired by resultant extensive rhegmatogenous pars
      plana vitrectomy, fluid-air exchange, and photocoagulation. Examination of
      the vitreous specimen disclosed numerous large macrophages with abundant
      cytoplasm distended by lipofuscin.

TI  - Polycythemia vera.
PG  - 1191-210
AB  - The differential diagnosis of an elevated hematocrit and the criteria for
      the diagnosis of polycythemia vera present little or no problem; however,
      there is not a consensus on therapy. Spivak likened this to a
      conundrum--"an intricate and difficult problem." Nonetheless, it can be
      argued that on the basis of the following criteria--life expectancy, the
      absence of toxicity, and long remissions an average of 3.1 years or a
      median of 2 years--and with acute leukemia no more common than in other
      regimens except phlebotomy alone (a regimen that cannot be sustained), 32P
      should be the treatment of choice except in pregnant women. Others, but
      not all, share this view. This is in contrast to the statement, "Thus
      chemotherapy treatment of [polycythemia vera] patients is not as easy,
      innocuous, and well tolerated as it is generally believed". Patients
      treated with phlebotomy alone were subjected to an unacceptably high
      incidence of early thrombotic events. Unavailability of pipobroman
      eliminates this choice.
